# Here we are load the EDDSA Scenario
Scenario 'eddsa': create the signature of an object 


Given I read the content of 'contracts/keyring.json'

Given I have the 'keyring' 
Given I have a 'string array' named 'asset' 

# Here we are creating an eddsa signature of an array and renaming it afterwards, 

When I create the eddsa signature of 'asset' 

# Here we are printing out the signatures  
Then print the 'asset' 
Then print the 'eddsa signature'
