Scenario eddsa: Verify the signature

# Here we load the EDDSA public key, the message and the signature 
Given I have a 'eddsa public key'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'asset'
Given I have a 'eddsa signature'

# Here we verify the signature
When I verify the 'asset' has a eddsa signature in 'eddsa signature' by 'eddsa public key'

# If the verification is successful, the next string is printed 
Then print string 'The EDDSA signature was verified'
