Given I have a 'base64' named 'iotaBlockToNotarize-mpack'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'iotaBlockToNotarize'


Given I have a 'hex' named 'txid'

When I create the 'decoded-newIotaBlock' decoded from mpack 'iotaBlockToNotarize-mpack'

Then print the 'txid'
Then print the 'iotaBlockToNotarize-mpack'
Then print the 'iotaBlockToNotarize'
# Then print the 'decoded-newIotaBlock' as 'string'
