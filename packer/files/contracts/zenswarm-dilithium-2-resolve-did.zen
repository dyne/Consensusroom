# post
Given I connect to 'endpoint' and pass it the content of 'post' and save the output into 'output'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'output'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'asset'

# extract the did document (I can not work directly here beacuse it is a string dictionary at the moment)
When I pickup from path 'output.result.W3C-DID'
When I rename 'W3C-DID' to 'did document'

Then print the 'did document'
Then print the 'asset'
