Scenario schnorr: Verify the signature

# Here we load the Schnorr public key, the message and the signature 
Given I have a 'schnorr public key'
Given I have a 'string dictionary' named 'asset'
Given I have a 'schnorr signature'

# Here we verify the signature
When I verify the 'asset' has a schnorr signature in 'schnorr signature' by 'schnorr public key'

# If the verification is successful, the next string is printed 
Then print string 'The Schnorr signature was verified'
